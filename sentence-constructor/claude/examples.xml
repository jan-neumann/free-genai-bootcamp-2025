        That sounds like an interesting sentence! Let's break it down.

        Vocabulary Table:
        | Japanese	| Romaji | English              |
        | --------- | ------ | -------------------- |
        |           | kuma	 | bear                 |    
        |           | doa	 | door                 |
        |           | gomi	 | garbage              |    
        |           | suteru | to throw away        |    
        |           | deru	 | to go out, to leave  |

        Possible Sentence Structure:

        The sentence seems to be composed of two parts: a statement about bears being at the door and a question about leaving the garbage out. You might want to use a casual tone for the question.
        One possible structure could be: [Statement about bears] + [Question about garbage].
        Clues:
        To say "bears are at the door," you might want to use the word "" (ni) to indicate location.
        For "did you leave the garbage out?", think about using the verb "" (suteru) in a question form and consider the verb conjugation for past tense.

        - BAD: in the vocabluary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank.
        - BAD: the beginner sentence is unecessary, should just start showing the vocabluary table.
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
        - BAD: The sentence structure says too much. We really want something that is
        conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb]?

        Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
