# Front End Prompt

We would like to build a Japanese language learning web app.

## Role/Profession
Frontend Developer

## Project Description

### Project Brief

We are building a japanese language learning web-app which serves the following purposes:
- A portal to launch study activities
- to store, group and explore japanese vocabulary
- to review study progress

The web-app is intended for desktop only, so we don't have to be concerned with mobile layouts.

## Technical Requirements
- React.js as frontend library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite.js as the local development server
- TypeScript for the programming language
- ShadCN for the UI components

## Frontend Routes
This is a list of routes for the web-app
Each of these routes are pages and we'll describe
them in more detail under the pages heading.

 - /dashboard
 - /study-activities
 - /study-activities/:id
 - /words
 - /words/:id
 - /groups
 - /groups/:id
 - /sessions
 - /settings
 - the default route / which redirects to /dashboard

## Global Components

### Navigation

There will be a horizontal navigation bar with the following links:
- Dashboard
- Study Activities
- Words
- Word Groups
- Sessions
- Settings

## Pages
