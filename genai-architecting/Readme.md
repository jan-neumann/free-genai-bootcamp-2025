## Functional Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure.
The reason is because there is a concern about the privacy of user
data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI will
greatly raise in cost.

They want to invest in an AI PC where they can afford to spend 10-15K.
They have 300 active students, and students are located within the city 
of Nagasaki.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful
enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15K.


We're just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet
and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

## Data Strategy

There is a concern of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply
materials and store them for access in our database.
