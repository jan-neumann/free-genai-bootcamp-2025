        "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a JLPT N5 level question in Japanese. The user has provided specific instructions, so I must follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I should start by understanding the structure required. The response must be a single JSON object with keys: introduction, conversation, question, options, and correct_answer_letter. Each of these has specific requirements.\n\nThe introduction is a string that sets the scene. It should be simple and in Japanese, using hiragana, katakana, and basic kanji. I'll think of a common scenario, maybe two people talking about their plans.\n\nNext, the conversation. It needs to be natural and simple, suitable for N5 level. I'll create a short dialogue between a man and a woman. Let's say they're discussing what to do on Sunday. The man suggests going to the mountains, and the woman agrees.\n\nThe question should be a string that asks about the content of the conversation. Something like, \"What are they talking about?\"\n\nFor the options, I need four distinct choices. They should be in Japanese and related to the conversation. The correct answer will be about going to the mountains. The other options could be about going to the sea, park, or shopping mall.\n\nThe correct_answer_letter is the letter corresponding to the correct option. In this case, if the correct option is the first one, it will be \"A\".\n\nI must ensure that all text is in Japanese, using appropriate characters without any English. Also, the JSON syntax must be correct with proper commas and quotes.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the introduction, conversation, question, options, and correct answer. I'll double-check that everything is enclosed correctly and that the JSON is valid.\n</think>\n\n<JSON>\n{\n    \"introduction\": \"男の人と女の人が話しています。\",\n    \"conversation\": \"女：今朝のニュース見た？\\n男：ううん、まだ見てないよ。何かあったの？\\n女：駅の近くに新しいレストランができたって。\",\n    \"question\": \"二人は何について話していますか？\",\n    \"options\": [\"レストランができたこと\", \"天気のこと\", \"仕事のこと\", \"週末の予定\"],\n    \"correct_answer_letter\": \"A\"\n}\n</JSON>",
